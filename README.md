## Summary
Overall this challenge is great because I haven't worked on any front-end development in almost 2 years. It is exciting to see my growth as a developer while brushing up on these skills and catching up with all the new updates to these frameworks and technologies.

### Proud learning moments during project

- Built React table to display Clients, or Payees.
- Used React Hooks for the first time.
- Implemented a few styled-components.

### Still want to work on and improve

- Could not get my subComponents/subRows to render
- UI/UX improvements including responsiveness
